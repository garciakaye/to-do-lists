# Your To-Do-Lists
> This single page application allows users to create different to-do-lists. The database for this app was built with Active Record and Sinatra, and the front-end was built with React and styled with Bootsrap.

## Features
### Create New List
> A new to-do list can be added by clicking on the 'Create New List' button, which toggles to show or hide the form, and typing the title of the list in the input field. When the 'Add List' is clicked on, the new list will render on the page and get saved to the database.
